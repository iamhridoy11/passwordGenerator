# passwordGenerator
Our program will ask us how many letters would you like in your password?

So I will say I would like a long password, let's say 14.

How many symbols, 3, how many numbers, 4, and it's going to generate me a password that is almost completely impossible to crack by any hacker, no matter how talented they are.
